A light Node.js Library that resolves Telegram usernames and/or ids to a complete User or/and Chat JSON object(s)

> Powered by pwrtelegramapi

## Background

The official Telegram API **does not** allow bots to resolve usernames/ids out of the box. One is forced to create his/her own database so as to resolve usernames. Resolving of usernames is particularly useful in that a bot is able to get a user/chat id of a person or groub it hasn't even seen! Unlike before where a bot is only able to see a person if it has ever recieved his/her message whether in private or in a group.

## Useful Scenarios

- Group administration bots
- In a bot which has lost its database, but users had previously started the bot
- General resolving to get user details e.g [UResolverBot](https://telegram.me/UResolverBot)
- And much more!


## Install

```bash
npm i tg-resolve -S
```

## Usage

_Refer to [example.js](https://github.com/kamikazechaser/tg-resolve/blob/master/example.js) for a more comprehensive guide_

- As of v1.2.0, you will need your own bot token!

## JSON Object Structure

_When resolving for a Group/Channel_

```javascript
{
id: -1001065761006,
title: "End Of The World Party",
username: "EOTWGroup",
type: "supergroup",
when: "2016-10-18 11:22:56"
}

```

_When resolving for a User_

```javascript
{
id: 58258161,
first_name: "John",
username: "john_doe",
type: "private",
last_name: "Doe",
when: "2016-10-18 11:22:56"
}
```
